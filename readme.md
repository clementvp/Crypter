> Encrypt unlimited bits. Remember only a bit.

**Crypter** is an innovative, convenient and secure cross-platform crypto app
that simplifies secure password generation and management by requiring you to
only remember one bit, the MasterPass. All prebuilt binaries for all major
platforms are available under
[releases](https://github.com/HR/Crypter/releases/latest).

This is based on [Crypto.Sync](https://github.com/HR/CryptoSync) (an end-to-end
cloud encryption client) which is a more elaborate implementation of the idea.
So please check it out as well!

## Status
[Crypter v3.0](https://github.com/HR/Crypter/releases/tag/v3.0.0) is a fully
fledged crypto app that can decrypt and encrypt any arbitrary data. This version
has been released and fully tested for macOS (OSX), Linux (for all distros via
[AppImage](http://appimage.org/)) and Windows (32 & 64 bit). All internal modules
are fully tested (90%+ coverage). Some end-to-end tests have been written (see
test/ui/test.js) but end-to-end testing is still mostly a WIP.

The next major release is [v3.1](https://github.com/HR/Crypter/milestones/v3.0)
and any work for it is done on the "dev" branch. All features to be implemented
for the next major version can be found at
https://github.com/HR/Crypter/milestones/v3.1. Feel free to send PRs to speed
this up!

If you have any suggestions then please open an issue!

## Crypto
> One key to derive them all!

Crypter uses a MasterPass (obtained at setup) to derive a MasterPassKey using
the PBKDF2 key derivation algorithm from the MasterPass (see below for spec). It
then derives very secure encryption keys that are used for the encryption of
files from the MasterPassKey using the PBKDF2 key derivation algorithm again.
This method allows for the generation of very secure encryption keys for data
encryption. Moreover, by just publicly storing the credentials used to
derive the MasterPassKey and the salts used to derive the encryption keys you
have the flexibility of deriving the encryption keys whenever you need to and
not having to worry about storing them securely. All you have to do is remember
your MasterPass.

Crypter never ever directly uses your MasterPass to encrypt anything but instead
derives a MasterPassKey from it which it then uses to derive the encryption key
(which is used directly to encrypt your file). Every time a file is decrypted,
the encryption key is re-derived from the MasterPassKey. Every time you set the
MasterPass through the setup or reset it (through Verify MasterPass), the
MasterPassKey is derived from the MasterPass using a newly generated set of
(random) credentials. These credentials are used to re-derive the MasterPassKey
every time the Crypter is executed (i.e. the app is launched).


Authentication is used by default since the AES-256-GCM symmetric block cipher
is used.

```js
// Crypto defaults
let defaults = {
  iterations: 50000, // file encryption key derivation iterations
  keyLength: 32, // encryption key length
  ivLength: 12, // initialisation vector length
  algorithm: 'aes-256-gcm', // encryption algorithm
  digest: 'sha256', // PBKDF2 hash function
  hash_alg: 'sha256', // default hashing function
  mpk_iterations: 100000 // MasterPassKey derivation iterations
}
```

### Encryption process
When encrypting a file, Crypter first creates a temporary hidden directory,
namely '.crypting'. It then encrypts the user selected file with the crypto
defaults and flushes the encrypted data to a file in the directory, namely
'data'. Furthermore, it writes the public credentials to a file within the same
directory, namely 'creds'. Finally, Crypter compresses the directory to a tar
archive with the name of the user selected file and the '.crypto' extension
appended to it.
### Decryption process
The decryption process is essentially the inverse of the encryption process
where the temporary hidden directory is named '.decrypting'. The credentials are
read from the creds file and used to decrypt the data file to the original user
file with its original extension which is deduced from the crypto file name
(e.g. extension for "file.txt.crypto" would be ".txt").
### Crypto file format
A .crypto file is the product of the Crypter encryption process. It stores both
the encrypted version of the user selected file and the public credentials used
to encrypt it (and needed to decrypt it). The file itself it is a tar archive
with the following structure:
```c
someFile.crypto
├── data // the encrypted version of the user selected file
└── creds // the public credentials used to encrypt it
```
### Public credentials
Certain credentials are required to decrypt the encrypted data as they are
needed to reconstruct the particular encryption key and verify data integrity.
These can be stored publicly without compromising security as it is fairly
impossible (by current standards) to reconstruct the encryption key without the
MasterPass and its credentials. The credentials are stored in the creds file of
the .crypto archive (as delineated above) in the following format:
```
Crypter#iv#authTag#salt
```


## Portability
When you encrypt a crypto file on one machine with Crypter and try to decrypt it
with Crypter running on a different machine then you most probably will come
across the following error:
```
ERROR: Unsupported state or unable to authenticate data
```
What happens is that the MasterPassKey originally used to derive the encryption
key on one machine is **not the same** as the MasterPassKey derived on a
different machine because the set of credentials generated on the other machine
is **different** (due to randomness). As a result your encryption key that is
derived from the MasterPassKey is different and so incorrect which yields the
error.

### Full portability
To achieve full portability the set of (MasterPassKey) credentials need to be
exported from Crypter on one machine and imported into Crypter on another
machine. The functionality is currently being implemented, see [#6](https://github.com/HR/Crypter/issues/6) for
[v3.0](https://github.com/HR/Crypter/milestone/2).

## Security

### Security-first practice
Crypter follows a security-first practice. This means that security is the
highest priority and first consideration. This means that, while Crypter seeks
to make encryption more convenient, Crypter chooses a convenient trade-off over
a higher level of security.

### MasterPassKey
Crypter uses a WeakMap to store the MasterPassKey inside the MasterPassKey class
using closure function. This makes the MasterPassKey data held in the object
(externally) inaccessible to an extent which increases the protection of the
MasterPassKey. The MasterPassKey is never flushed to the filesystem and always
kept in (main) memory. Since JS does not give control over or allow such a
low-level operation as wiping memory, the program relies on the garbage
collection and volatility of the main memory for the permanent erasure of the
MasterPassKey stored in memory.

A decent number of iterations (see above specs) are used for the derivation of
the MasterPassKey to mitigate brute-force attacks. A good amount of iterations
are used for the derivation of the encryption keys from the MasterPasKey this is
so that performance and speed is not significantly compromised. For critical
application, you may choose to select 10,000,000 iterations instead (in
app/core/crypto.js). Refer to
http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-132.pdf for
more info

Crypter generates a new set of random credentials for deriving the MasterPassKey
every time the MasterPass is set (at setup) or reset. Using randomness, mitigate
brute-force attacks which drastically improves security.

## Dev
The "dev" branch is the development branch and may be unstable. However the
"master" branch will always be kept stable.  So issue pull requests for
improvements mainly on the dev branch.
### Install (dependencies)
To install all dependencies run
```
$ npm install
```

### Run
Uses gulp for a few things (so install gulp it globally if haven't already) and
so to start the app simply run
```
$ gulp
```
### Test
Uses mainly mocha (+ chai) for testing. Since the project uses a lot of JS ES6
syntax, babel is used as a transpiler. To run all the tests
```
$ npm test
```
Uses istanbul for coverage. To run test coverage
```
$ gulp coverage
```

### Build
Binaries (available under releases) have been build using Electron ```v1.1.3```.
Crypter uses electron-builder to build binaries so install it globally first
prior to any build
```
$ npm install electron-builder@next -g
```
The following instructions are for building Crypter on and for the respective
platform stated

To build the app for your **macOS**
```
$ build -m
```
To build the app for your **Linux**
```
$ sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends -y icnsutils graphicsmagick xz-utils
$ build -l --x64 --ia32
```
To build the app for your **Windows** x84 and/or x64
```
$ build -w --x64 --ia32
```
